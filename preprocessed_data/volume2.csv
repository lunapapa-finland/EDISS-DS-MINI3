"And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.
  ","['the holidays', 'Harry felt']"
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache.,[]
"He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).

What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer?,"['Harry', 'House', 'all summer']"
What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done?,"['Dursleys', 'Harry']"
"The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
  and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame.",[]
"Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.
  ","['Uncle Vernon', 'Harry', 'Hedwig']"
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family.,['Harry']
"Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky.","['Vernon', 'Aunt Petunia', 'Dudley']"
"Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy.",['Harry']
"He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
  ",[]
"It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.",['Harry']
"This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before.
  ","['Harry', 'eleven years before']"
"At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak.","['the age of one year old', 'Harry']"
"Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband.,['Harry']
"He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.

"And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry,
  and the whole story had come out.","['a year ago', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry']"
"Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.

The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday.,"['today', 'Harry', 'twelfth']"
"Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely ...
