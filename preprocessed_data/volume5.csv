He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive.,['Privet Drive']

"Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen Hippogriff.

"In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake.",['Cedric']
"Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more.",['Ron']

He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up.,[]
The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park.,[]

Went to daring Gryffindor.

Grawp
The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors.","['Peeves', 'Harry', 'Fred and George', ""Fred and George's"", 'the next few days', 'Harry', 'a week', 'Umbridge']"
In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them.,[]

Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon.,['Fred and George']
"For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing.","['one', 'fifth']"
Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success.,"['Umbridge', 'Filch']"
"Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms.",['Filch']
"Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.
    ","['Harry', 'McGonagall', ""Fred and George's"", 'Umbridge']"
"Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters.","['two', 'Umbridge', ""Fred and George's Cleansweeps""]"

"Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief.","[""Fred and George's"", 'Troublemakers']"

"Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.

"Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn.",['Filch']
"The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members.",['The Inquisitorial Squad']
"Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione's delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers.

"Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts.","['George', 'Hogwarts']"
"Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils.",[]
"Shrieking with rage and frustration, she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from 'Umbridge - 'itis'.",[]

"Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour,
    from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker.",['Mrs Norris']
"Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.
