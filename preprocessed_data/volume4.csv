"Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.

"The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.",[]
"Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.

"Elderly Mr. and Mrs.
  Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.",['Tom']
"All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.

"The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders.","['Hanged Man', 'that night']"
"They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.

"""Never!""
  Frank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener.","['Frank Bryce', 'Riddles']"
He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.,['the Riddle House']
"Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.

"""Horrible temper,"" said Dot, nodding fervently.",['Dot']
"""I remember, when he was a kid...""
  By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.
  ","['the following morning', 'Little Hangleton', 'Frank Bryce', 'Riddles']"
"But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.","['Great Hangleton', 'Frank', 'the day', 'Riddles']"
"Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.
  ",['Frank']
"Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.
  ","['Frank', 'Riddles']"
The police had never read an odder report.,[]
"A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.",['Riddles']
"In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead.",['Riddles']
"The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?
  ","['Riddles', 'three']"
"As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.","['Riddles', 'Frank']"
"The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.","['Riddles', 'Little Hangleton']"
"To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.
  ","['Frank Bryce', 'the Riddle House']"
"""'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say,""
  said Dot in the Hanged Man.",['Dot']
"""And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.",[]
"""
  ",[]
But Frank did not leave.,['Frank']
"He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long.",['the Riddle House']
"Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.
  ",['Frank']
"The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for ""tax reasons,"" though nobody was very clear what these might be.","['the Riddle House', 'these days']"
"The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however.",['Frank']
"Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.
  ",['Frank']
Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either.,['Frank']
Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House.,['the Riddle House']
They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.,['Frank']
"Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare.",[]
"They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.",['Frank']
"Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer.",['Frank']
"So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.
  ","['Frank', 'one night', 'August', 'one']"
It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age.,['Frank']
He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee.,[]
"Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.
  ",['the Riddle House']
Frank knew at once what was going on.,['Frank']
"The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.
  ",[]
"Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths.","['Frank', 'Riddles']"
"He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door.",[]
"He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.
  ",['the night']
"The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows.",['the Riddle House']
"Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.
  ",['Frank']
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.,[]
"Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.","['Frank', 'many years']"
"He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.
  ",[]
"On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.",['Frank']
"Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
  ",['Frank']
"The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate.",[]
This surprised him.,[]
"Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.
  ",[]
"""There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.",[]
"""
  ""Later,"" said a second voice.",['second']
"This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.",[]
Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up.,['Frank']
"""Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.",['Wormtail']
"""
  Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.",['Frank']
"There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor.",[]
"Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place.",['Frank']
"He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.",[]
"Then he went out of sight again.
  ",[]
"""Where is Nagini?"" said the cold voice.
  ",['Nagini']
"""I -- I don't know, My Lord,"" said the first voice nervously.",['first']
"""She set out to explore the house, I think...""
  ""You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,"" said the second voice.","['Wormtail', 'second']"
"""I will need feeding in the night.",[]
The journey has tired me greatly.,[]
"""
  Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard.","['Brow', 'Frank']"
"There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.

"""My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?""
  ""A week,"" said the cold voice.",['A week']
"""Perhapse longer.",[]

  Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it.",['Frank']

"""The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?"" said Wormtail.","['the Quidditch World Cup', 'Wormtail']"
(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.),['Frank']
"""Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over?""
  ""Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities.","['the World Cup', 'the Ministry of Magic']"

"Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals.","['Frank', 'only two']"
"Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.

  Another pause, more protracted, and then -- ""Without Harry Potter?"" breathed the second voice softly.","['Without Harry Potter', 'second']"

Where was this place?,[]
It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle.,[]
